→ Base adjacency list
→ Static pruning (forbidden hubs + unreachable hubs)
→ Choose time horizon T (start small)
→ Time expansion
→ Add hub-occupancy capacity per time step (node-splitting per (hub,time))
→ Time-expanded pruning (forward/backward reachability windows)
→ Min-Cost Max-Flow (send K drones)
→ Flow decomposition (extract K paths / schedules)
